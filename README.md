# SQLAlchemy-Flask


Greetings,

Welcome to the SQLAlchemy-Flask repository! This project utilizes Python and SQLAlchemy to conduct a basic data exploration and analysis against a climate database. Through SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, Matplotlib and Flask, climate data stored as a .sqlite file is accessed, analyzed, visualized and subsequently hosted as a local API with Flask.

**Repository Stucture:**
- 'SurfsUp' directory:
  - 'Resources' dircetory: Contains original climate database as a .sqlite file and as two separate CSV files
  - "app.py": Flask application
  - "climate_starter.ipynb": Exploratory data analysis and visualizations

Cheers!
